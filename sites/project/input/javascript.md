# Transom JavaScript

In Transom, JavaScript is the dynamic, page-display time counterpart
to Python, which is used at site-generation time.  It is lightweight
by design, since we try to do as much as possible in Python.

<div class="code-label">input/site.js</div>

~~~ javascript
{{strip(include("../../profiles/website/input/site.js"))}}
~~~

<div class="code-label">config/transom/base.js</div>

~~~ javascript
{{strip(include("config/transom/base.js"))}}
~~~

<div class="code-label">config/transom/components.js</div>

~~~ javascript
{{strip(include("config/transom/components.js"))}}

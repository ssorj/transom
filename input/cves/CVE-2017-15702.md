# CVE-2017-15702

## Severity

Important

## Affected components

Qpid Broker-J

## Affected versions

0.18 through 0.32

## Fixed versions

[6.0.0]({{site_url}}/releases/qpid-java-6.0.0/index.html)

## Description

If the broker is configured with different authentication providers on
different ports one of which is an HTTP port, then the broker can be
tricked by a remote unauthenticated attacker connecting to the HTTP
port into using an authentication provider that was configured on a
different port.  The attacker still needs valid credentials with the
authentication provider on the spoofed port.  This becomes an issue
when the spoofed port has weaker authentication protection (e.g.,
anonymous access, default accounts) and is normally protected by
firewall rules or similar which can be circumvented by this
vulnerability.  AMQP ports are not affected.  Versions 6.0.0 and newer
are not affected.

## Resolution

Users of affected versions who have more than one port and different
authentication providers configured on them should upgrade to a
later unaffected version (recommended).

## Mitigation

If upgrading the broker is not possible then users should ensure all
their authentication providers offer an equal amount of protection.
In particular, authentication providers with default accounts and
those with anonymous access should be removed if other providers in
use require credentials.

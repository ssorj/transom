# CVE-2016-4974

## Severity

Moderate

## Affected components

AMQP 0-x JMS

## Affected versions

6.0.3 and earlier

## Fixed versions

6.0.4 and later

## Description

Deserialization of untrusted input while using JMS ObjectMessage.

When applications call getObject() on a consumed JMS ObjectMessage
they are subject to the behaviour of any object deserialization during
the process of constructing the body to return.  Unless the application
has taken outside steps to limit the deserialization process, they
can't protect against input that might try to make undesired use of
classes available on the application classpath that might be
vulnerable to exploitation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker would need to be able to inject a suitably crafted AMQP
message containing the malicious JMS Object Message into the AMQP
message network. For this, the attacker would require valid
authentication credentials and suitable authorisation.

## Mitigation

Users using ObjectMessage can upgrade to Qpid AMQP 0-x JMS client 6.0.4
or or later, and use the new configuration options to whitelist trusted
content permitted for deserialization. When so configured, attempts to
deserialize input containing other content will be prevented.
Alternatively, users of older client releases may utilise other means
such as agent-based approaches to help govern content permitted for
deserialization in their application.

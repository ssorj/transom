# AMQP

The Advanced Message Queueing Protocol is at the heart of everything
we do at Qpid. It is an open standard designed to support reliable,
high-performance messaging over the internet. AMQP can be used for any
distributed application and supports common messaging patterns such as
point-to-point, fan-out, publish-subscribe, and request-response.

## AMQP 1.0

The AMQP working group released the 1.0 specification in the final
quarter of 2011. Future evolution of the protocol is now driven by the
member section and technical committees at OASIS.

In October 2012 AMQP 1.0 became an [OASIS Standard][oasis].  In May
2014 AMQP was approved as an
[ISO and IEC International Standard][iso].

AMQP 1.0 is fully symmetric (peer-to-peer) as opposed to its
asymmetric (client-server) predecessors. This means it can be used
with or without intermediaries such as brokers and offers new
possibilities for messaging applications.

Qpid offers AMQP 1.0 support in the following components:

Qpid also offers lists for
[commits]({{site_url}}/source-code.html#commits-list) and
[notifications]({{site_url}}/source-code.html#notifications-list).

**NOTE**: The Qpid project offers various components in many different
languages. When mailing the lists, please be specific about which
component, or even which part of a given component, that you are
using. For example, "I'm using the Qpid Broker-J
&lt;version&gt; with the Qpid JMS &lt;version&gt; AMQP 1.0 client"
rather than "I'm using the broker and JMS client".
